# RADIX SORT :
* Radix sort is a special sorting algorithm that works on lists of numbers
* It exploits the fact that information about the size of a number is encoded in the number of digits.  
* More digits means a bigger number!
* It never makes comparisons between elements!
* Not a comparision sort.

RADIX SORT PSEUDOCODE
* Define a function that accepts list of numbers
* Figure out how many digits the largest number has
* Loop from k = 0 up to this largest number of digits
* For each iteration of the loop:
   - Create buckets for each digit (0 to 9)
   - place each number in the corresponding bucket based on its kth digit
* Replace our existing array with values in our buckets, starting with 0 and going up to 9
* return list at the end!
