Q) What is recursion?
A process (a function in our case) that calls itself

Two essential parts of a recursive function!
    Base Case
    Different Input

Q) How recursive functions work
Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach your base case!

Q) Base Case
The condition when the recursion ends.
This is the most important concept to understand 

Q) Where things go wrong
No base case
Forgetting to return or returning the wrong thing!
Stack overflow! 
function factorial(num){
    if(num === 1) return 1;
    return num * factorial(num);
}
function factorial(num){
    if(num === 1) console.log(1) ;
    return num * factorial(num-1);
}

# Pure Recursion Tips :
For arrays, use methods like slice, the spread operator, and concat that make copies of arrays so you do not mutate them
Remember that strings are immutable so you will need to use methods like slice, substr, or substring to make copies of strings
To make copies of objects use Object.assign, or the spread operator
