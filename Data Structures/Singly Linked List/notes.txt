Singly Linked Lists :


What is a linked list?
A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.
Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null.


Comparisons with Arrays :
        Lists 
Do not have indexes!
Connected via nodes with a next pointer
Random access is not allowed
Contains a head, tail and length property.

        Arrays
Indexed in order!
Insertion and deletion can be expensive
Can quickly be accessed at a specific index

--------------
Pushing
Adding a new node to the end of the Linked List!

Pushing pseudocode :
Let's visualize this!

1. This function should accept a value
2. Create a new node using the value passed to the function
3. If there is no head property on the list, set the head and tail to be the newly created node
4. Otherwise set the next property on the tail to be the new node and set the tail property on the list to be the newly created node
5. Increment the length by one
6. Return the linked list
