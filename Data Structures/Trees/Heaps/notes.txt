https://visualgo.net/en/heap

WHAT IS A BINARY HEAP?
-Very similar to a binary search tree, but with some different rules!
-In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes

# MAX BINARY HEAP:
P > L & R 
-Each parent has at most two child nodes
-The value of each parent node is always greater than its child nodes
-In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes.
-A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first

Why do we need to know this?
-Binary Heaps are used to implement Priority Queues, which are very commonly used data structures
-They are also used quite a bit, with graph traversal algorithms

THERE'S AN EASY WAY OF STORING A BINARY HEAP...
A LIST/ARRAY

# To Find CHILD :
For any index of an array n...
The left child is stored at 2n + 1
The right child is at 2n + 2

# To find paretnt :
For any child node at index  n...
Its parent is at index (n-1)/2
                            floored

#Big O of Binary Heaps
Insertion -   O(log N)
Removal -   O(log N)
Search -   O(N)       

# DEFINING OUR CLASS
Class Name:
       MaxBinaryHeap
Properties:
       values = []

# Adding to a MaxBinaryHeap :
1. Add to the end
2. Bubble up
---------------------------------------------------
# INSERT PSEUDOCODE :
- Push the value into the values property on the heap
- Bubble the value up to its correct spot!

INSERT Detailed PSEUDOCODE
*Push the value into the values property on the heap
*Bubble Up:
    -Create a variable called index which is the length of the values property - 1
    -Create a variable called parentIndex which is the floor of (index-1)/2
    -Keep looping as long as the values element at the parentIndex is less than the values element at the child index
        -Swap the value of the values element at the parentIndex with the value of the element property at the child index
        -Set the index to be the parentIndex, and start over!

# REMOVING FROM A HEAP
1. Remove the root
2. Replace with the most recently added
3. Adjust (sink down)        

SINK DOWN?
The procedure for deleting the root from the heap (effectively extracting the maximum element in a max-heap or the
 minimum element in a min-heap) and restoring the properties is called down-heap (also known as bubble-down, percolate-down, sift-down, trickle down, heapify-down, cascade-down, and extract-min/max).

# REMOVING :
(also called extractMax)

* Swap the first value in the values property with the last one
* Pop from the values property, so you can return the value at the end.
* Have the new root "sink down" to the correct spot...â€‹
    - Your parent index starts at 0 (the root)
    - Find the index of the left child: 2 * index + 1 (make sure its not out of bounds)
    - Find the index of the right child: 2*index + 2 (make sure its not out of bounds)
    - If the left or right child is greater than the element...swap. If both left and right children are larger, swap with the largest child.
    - The child index you swapped to now becomes the new parent index.  
    - Keep looping and swapping until neither child is larger than the element.
    - Return the old root!

                        # BUILDING A PRIORITY QUEUE

Q) WHAT IS A PRIORITY QUEUE?
- A data structure where each element has a priority. Elements with higher priorities are served before elements with lower priorities.

# It is a abstract topic we can do it many other ways rather than heap, but heap is the easiest one. 

# Code Structure : 
    Class Name:
           Node
    Properties:
           val
           priority

    Class Name:
           PriorityQueue
    Properties:
           values = []

# A NAIVE VERSION :
Use a list to store all elements

priority: 1
priority: 2
priority: 3
priority: 4
priority: 5

Iterate over the entire thing to find the highest priority element.

# Value doesn't matter. Heap is constructed using Priority

# OUR PRIORITY QUEUE :
- Write a Min Binary Heap - lower number means higher priority.
- Each Node has a val and a priority.  Use the priority to build the heap.
- Enqueue method accepts a value and priority, makes a new node, and puts it in the right spot based off of its priority.
- Dequeue method removes root element, returns it, and rearranges heap using priority.

# MaxHeapify
Converting an array into a MaxBinaryHeap

- Create a new heap
- Iterate over the array and invoke your insert function
- return the values property on the heap
----------------------------------------------------

# Heapsort
Let's visualize this!

We can sort an array in O(n log n) time and O(1) space by making it a heap!

1. Make the array a max heap (use maxHeapify)
2. Loop over the array, swap the root node with last item in the array
3. After swapping each item, run maxHeapify again to find the next root node
4. Next loop you'll swap the root node with the second-to-last item in the array and run maxHeapify again.
5. Once you've run out of items to swap, you have a sorted array! 
-------------------------------------------------------------

#RECAP :
1. Binary Heaps are very useful data structures for sorting, and implementing other data structures like priority queues
2. Binary Heaps are either MaxBinaryHeaps or MinBinaryHeaps with parents either being smaller or larger than their children
3. With just a little bit of math, we can represent heaps using arrays!
